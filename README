 CSS::Parser - parser for CSS-style syntax
 v0.61 - 21/10/1999
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The CSS::Parser deals simply with fairly loose CSS syntax.
It doesn't know anything about what it is parsing, for that
see other classes. This allows it to be the base for CSS::CSSn,
CSS::STTSn and any other parser for a css-compatible syntax.


Chances are, you will want to use one of the existing subclasses or
to subclass it yourself.


PREREQUISITES
=============

You need perl 5.005 or better.


INSTALL
=======

Simple as usual:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install


TODO
====

	- add tests
	- improve performance (not bad but could probably be improved)
	- make compatible with version of Perl prior to 5.005 (?)

I am very open to suggestions, please email me any comment you have or
any problem you face using this module.


CHANGES
=======


v0.61

	Stupid make tardist error, I somehow managed to scrap the README


v0.60 21/10/1999

	Complete rewrite, now parses at-rules. The principle has changed as
	it now parses a very loose CSS syntax and delegates making sense of
	it to subclasses. The interface may still evolve but will remain
	backwards compatible. This module is now considered beta.


Several rewrites that weren't made public.

v0.06 12/08/1999

	Fixes the previous small bugs


v0.05 07/08/1999

	First public release, had a few bugs and didn't parse at-rules
